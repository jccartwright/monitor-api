[[overview]]
= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

HealthChecks notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

HealthChecks notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

[[overview-headers]]
== Headers

Every response has the following header(s):

include::{snippets}/headers-example/response-headers.adoc[]

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

|===
|Path|Type|Description

|`error`
|`String`
|The HTTP error that occurred, e.g. `Bad Request`

|`message`
|`String`
|A description of the cause of the error

|`path`
|`String`
|The path to which the request was made

|`status`
|`Number`
|The HTTP status code, e.g. `404`

|`timestamp`
|`Number`
|The time, in milliseconds, at which the error occurred

|`exception`
|`String`
|The exception thrown by the server

|===

For example, a request that attempts to retreive a non-existent healthCheck will produce a
`404 Not Found` response:

[source,http,options="nowrap"]
----
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

{
  "timestamp": 1471102582993,
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "exception": "gov.noaa.ncei.gis.web.HealthCheckNotFoundException",
  "message": "could not find HealthCheck 9999.",
  "path": "/healthChecks/9999"
}
----

[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

The MapServices Monitor uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application
from resource to resource.
Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate
